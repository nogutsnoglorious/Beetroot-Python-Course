# Yes, we can change PYTHONPATH variable from sys.path, which is represented as a list.
# We can write in terminal the next sequence of code:

# python - to activate an environment
# import sys - to import sys module
# print(sys.path) - to get the list of folders which Python is looking through while searching necessary information
# sys.path.append('path\\to\\necessary\\folder') - to add new folder to a list
